# SparkOS

With growing enthusiasm for container technologies like Docker, a relatively new architectural model - Unikernel is also beginning to gain popularity. The unikernels aim to improve performance by separating functionality at the com-
ponent level and eliminating unnecessary components. Apache Spark has become popular data processing tool due to its in-memory processing capabilities which provides significant edge over Hadoop. Since Spark is a resource intensive application. 

We present an approach of combining Spark with unikernels with a goal of achieving performance gain and security over standard spark deployment. The benchmark data supports performance gain.
